# Introduction

> Accelerate building of your serverless applications.

## What is NeuStack

NeuStack accelerates building of your serverless applications using modern practices and tooling. NeuStack takes away all the grunt work of building CI/CD pipelines, figuring out the cloud deployment models, managing various environments through configuration.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide to get started.

## Features
- **CI/CD**: Turnkey CI/CD for all your NeuStack apps that includes build, running unit tests, security scan, code quality reports, gated approvals and more.
- **Git Repos**: NeuStack integrates with [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
- **Runtime**: Support for [Go](https://golang.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/).
- **Templates**: Customizable templates for your service type and runtime that includes logging, configuration and more, so that your developers can just write code.
- **Security**: Secure from day 1 by using principles of least privilege and applying security to all layers (edge, VPC).
- **Environments**: Automatic Environment Management - from creation to destruction - following the developer's git workflow.
- **Metrics**: Operational metrics for your NeuStack services.
- **Serverless Services**: Support for all the popular AWS serverless services.
- **Governance** - NeuStack admins can set policies and NeuStack will enforce them during the life cycle of services created through the platform.
- **Compliance** - Setup your cloud compliance rules in NeuStack (encryption at rest, no public S3 buckets, approvals for prod environment, tagging) and the platform will automatically enforce them.


Optional: 
- **Logging** - You can opt-in to push your logs to our ELK stack or have the logs configured to push to your ELK, Splunk or any other logging service. 
- **Vulnerability Scan** - You can opt-in to have your code scanned for vulnerabilities.
